# Inheritance
Inheritance is called the ability of existing a class to depend on another class and use its properties. These properties are: Instance variables and methods.
##Important terminology:
-Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).
-Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
-Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

##Inheritance Types:
-Single Inheritance:
In single Inheritance, subclass inherit only one superclass.

-Hierarchical Inheritance:
In hierarchical Inheritance, superclass inherit to one or more subclass.

-Another Inheritance:
Another programing language you can create multiple superclass or subclass, unfortunately this is not defined in C#
