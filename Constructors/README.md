# Constructors
A constructor is a special method of the class which gets automatically invoked whenever an instance of the class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains the collection of instructions that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is used to assign initial values to the data members of the same class. 

###Important points to Remember About Constructors
- Constructor of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
- A constructor can not be abstract, final, and Synchronized.
- Within a class, you can create only one static constructor.
- A constructor doesnâ€™t have any return type, not even void.
- A static constructor cannot be a parameterized constructor.
- A class can have any number of constructors.
- Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.
